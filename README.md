# Sales Reporting and Prediction System (PHP-SRePS)

Submission for Development Project 2 - Design, Planning and Management

--

Sales Reporting and Prediction System (PHP-SRePS) is a new desktop software application to replace the paper-based sales recording system currently used by People Health Pharmacy (PHP) Inc..  The company is in need of a system able to use historical data to aid the manager by making product-ordering more simple and efficient. The software will offer a GUI to display sales for easy viewing and it will also export this data in a CSV format to allow for further processing. 

The PHP-SRePS will have the functionality to manage stock levels and record sales.  The stock levels will be managed using a SQL database.  Sales entered into the system will modify the levels of stock as items are sold.  

The application will also produce reports of weekly and monthly sales for observation by the store manager, and will analyse sales trends to produce a report of suggested stock to order.  This report will be generated in a CSV format for further processing.  The software will utilise an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI) for front-end use.
